# review-classifier
Code for classifying restaurant reviews on Yelp
This notebook extracts restaaurant reviews from Yelp using Yelp Fusion API and classifies them as positive or negative using nltk. The problem here is that the reviews are imbalanced as most people tend to give an average or above average rating.
To run this code, a token is needed which can be created from here https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3 and it should be added in the YELP_TOKEN variable.
